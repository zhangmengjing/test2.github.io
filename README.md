You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zhangmengjing/test2.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Abstract:

With the aim of provision of high-quality information, services and items to users, advanced Internet and multimedia services have experienced an exponential growth and advanced rapidly over the past decades. A huge amount of user-generated and service provider-generated multimedia data become available. These data are heterogeneous and multi-modal in nature, imposing great challenges for processing and analyzing them. Multi-modal data consist of a mixture of various types of data from different modalities such as texts, images, videos, audios etc. Data-driven correlational representation and knowledge-guided learning are the main scientific problems for multimedia analysis. 

This special session aims at bringing together researchers and professionals from academia and industry from around the world for showcasing, discussing, and reviewing the whole spectrum of technological opportunities, challenges, solutions, and emerging applications in knoweldge-driven multi-modal deep analysis for multimedia,. We especially encourage original work based on interdisciplinary research, such as computer science and social science, where quantitative evidence is available demonstrating the mutual advantage of such an approach. 

#### Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:
* Multi-modal representation learning with knowledge
* Multi-modal data fusion with knowledge 
* Knowledge representation for multi-modal data  
* Deep cross-modality alignment with knowledge
* Methodology and architectures to improve model explainability with knowledge
* Multi-modal deep analysis for innovative multimedia applications, such as person reidentification, social network analysis, cross-modal retrieval, recommendation systems and so on.

### Important Dates
#### Submission of papers:
* Regular Paper submission (including Special Sessions) : November 29, 2020
* Submission of papers to workshops and other tracks : March 13, 2021
* Industry/Application track paper submission : March 22, 2021
